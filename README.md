# Snake Game

A terminal-based version of the classic Snake game.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** or **WSAD** keys to control the snake.
- The goal is to eat the food (`F`) that appears on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and you score 10 points.
- The game is over if the snake runs into the walls or into itself.
- If you fill the entire board with the snake, you advance to the next level where the snake moves faster.
