# Snake Game

## Description
A terminal-based implementation of the classic Snake game, written in C++.

## How to Play
- Use **Arrow Keys** or **W/A/S/D** keys to control the snake.
- The goal is to eat the food (`F`) that appears on the screen.
- Each piece of food eaten increases the snake's length and your score.
- The game is over if the snake runs into the walls or into itself.
- Complete a level by filling the entire board with the snake.
